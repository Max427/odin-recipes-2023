        <p>This is a tuna casserole that even my picky family loves! The potato chips give the casserole a crunchy crust. Try serving with a side of roasted Brussels sprouts.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 (12 ounce) package egg noodles</li>
                    <li>2 (10.5 ounce) cans condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
                    <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
                    <li>2 (5 ounce) cans tuna, drained</li>
                    <li>1 cup frozen green peas</li>
                    <li>½ (4.5 ounce) can sliced mushrooms</li>
                    <li>¼ cup chopped onion</li>
                    <li>1 cup crushed potato chips</li>

                    <h2>Steps</h2>

                            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rapid boil. Cook egg noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 7 to 9 minutes; drain.</li>
                            <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
                            <li>Mix noodles, condensed soup, 1 cup cheese, tuna, peas, mushrooms, and onion in a large bowl until well combined.</li>
                            <li>Transfer the mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
                            <li>Top the mixture with crushed potato chip and remaining 1 cup of cheese.</li>
                            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbly, about 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
                            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
